# Melbourne Airbnb Price Prediction - Project

# Members: Marko Mikulic

In this project, we build a price prediction model of Airbnb listings and make comparisons between
different methods. The input to our algorithm is Melbourne Airbnb Open Data [Mel, 2018] which
contains continuous / categorical data about listings.

We  use linear regression, ridge regression, random forest regression and gradient boosting methods to output the predicted prices
of listings.

Initially, the dataset contains 22895 entries with 84 columns, which consist of 83 features and 1 response column.
